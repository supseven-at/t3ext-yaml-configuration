# TYPO3 extension: yaml_configuration

## Features of `supseven/yaml-configuration`

* Export and import any table to and from a YAML file.
* Export a defined table to yaml in the TYPO3 backend interface.

> This extension was initially a fork of
> [Tuurlijk/t3ext-yaml-configuration (Branch task/9-5-lts)](https://github.com/Tuurlijk/t3ext-yaml-configuration/tree/task/9-5_lts).
> It was refactored for TYPO3 9.5 by
> [Josef Glatz](https://github.com/josefglatz/) in the source repository
> and became forked afterwards. With this step, we can perfectly
> continue to maintain the extension without external dependencies.
